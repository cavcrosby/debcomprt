Description: Manages debian compartments, an underlying 'target' generated from debootstrap
 Debian compartments are chrooted environments created normally with deboostrap
 but with added configuration. Features include:
  - A named configuration script to configure the chrooted environment
  - A optional file that will have debootstrap install additional packages
  - The ability to chroot with appropriate filesystems mounted for normal system
  usage
