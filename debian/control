Description: Creates debian compartments, an underlying 'target' generated from debootstrap
 Debian compartments are chrooted environments created normally with deboostrap
 but with added functionality. Currently those are:
  - A named configuration script is required to configure the chrooted environment
  - A file can be specified that will have debootstrap install additional packages
