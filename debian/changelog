debcomprt (2.0.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Have debcomprt run as subcommands now.
  * Implement chroot command for debcomprt to use with comprts.
  * Fix dangling chroot issue, per a done TODO:
    It was discovered that exitChroot was not deferred in MANY
    cases. Meaning, if any part of the code after the Chroot returned an
    err, then exitChroot would never be called. Leading to possibly a 
    defunct system.
  * Quiet option has now been implemented in the code.
  * Comprtinc no longer uses a file extension. Codebase has been updated
    to reflect this.
  * For mounting filesystems, in the event the device is not recognized, a
    default case has been added for default permissions. Though, this should be
    used with discretion.
  * These releases will now be under a 'stable' distribution.
