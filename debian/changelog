debcomprt (2.1.0-1) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * These releases will now be under a 'bullseye' distribution.
    * The target machine operating system is bullseye, so I think this can
      be justified. The previous entries can also be assumed for bullseye 
      as well.
    * A tad related, lintian's error 'bad-distribution-in-changes-file'
      requires a explicit debian profile to be used (e.g. otherwise my
      development machine may assume Ubuntu by default). This has been
      appended as an option to lintian through debuild. For reference:
      https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lintian/+bug/1303603

  * Include setup for debian's maintainer scripts (e.g. prerm, preinst).
  * Integrate 'go generate' to allow a make synced program data directory
    between the go code and maintainer scripts.
    * A configuration file on the filesystem would have been ok for the 
      debcomprt to read but in my eyes, the above configuration should
      not exist to appear as if it can be changed without repercussion.
        * Said configuration file was never intended to be used by the
          maintainer scripts.

debcomprt (2.0.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Have debcomprt run as subcommands now.
  * Implement chroot command for debcomprt to use with comprts.
  * Fix dangling chroot issue, per a done TODO:
    It was discovered that exitChroot was not deferred in MANY
    cases. Meaning, if any part of the code after the Chroot returned an
    err, then exitChroot would never be called. Leading to possibly a 
    defunct system.
  * Quiet option has now been implemented in the code.
  * Comprtinc no longer uses a file extension. Codebase has been updated
    to reflect this.
  * For mounting filesystems, in the event the device is not recognized, a
    default case has been added for default permissions. Though, this should be
    used with discretion.
  * These releases will now be under a 'stable' distribution.
