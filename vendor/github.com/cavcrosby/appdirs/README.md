# appdirs

This is a port of the excellent python module named the same, which can be found here [appdirs](https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs). 

The README and documentation in the original should be a good starting point. Documentation is currently lacking on the port itself, but the API is very similar to the python version.

Credits go to Wesley Bitter for the original implementation. The purposes of this fork currently is to attached the appdirs go package to a Go module. This allows the package to be versioned as needed as part of Go module's dependency management.
